# Formalization of the Problem

## Area of Application

Our project device is intended for use by hobbyists, amateurs, enthusiasts, and for educational purposes. The product should be used in pairs, never more than one at a time, and in an isolated environment.

## Scope

The goal of our project is the development and implementation of a wireless audio transceiver system specifically designed for electric guitars. The system aims to provide seamless wireless connectivity, low latency for real-time audio transmission, clear audio signals, and portability for users, especially those in amateur settings. The main goal is to tackle the issues related to wired connections in musical performances, providing a new solution that meets the requirements of casual or amateur musicians who want an efficient and cable-free experience.

## Out of Scope

While our focus remains on the key attributes mentioned above, it is important to note that this product is primarily designed for amateur users and may not address the intricacies associated with professional audio setups. Compatibility with specific devices, stringent security protocols, and the reliability requirements necessary for professional-grade performances are considered out of scope.  However, future iterations or extensions of this project may explore incorporating compatibility, security features, and reliability enhancements for broader applicability.
