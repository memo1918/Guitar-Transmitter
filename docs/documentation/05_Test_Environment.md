# Setting up the Test-Environment

The test environment includes two power supplies, an oscilloscope, an amplifier, a function generator, two Pi Pico debug probes, a multimeter and breadboards. An electric guitar and a stopwatch were occasionally used. The breadboards were connected correctly according to the circuit diagram. The work on the transmitter and receiver was done using two different CMake projects. Verification was done in two ways: Firstly, we used NumPy to easily plot the large buffer data and examine the values. Secondly, we were also able to audibly verify the final signal through the amplifier.
