# Conclusion

In conclusion, our wireless audio transceiver prototype for electric guitars has provided valuable insights and achieved significant milestones in addressing the challenges associated with wired connections in musical performances. We focused on providing seamless wireless connectivity, low-latency real-time audio transmission, and portability for amateur users, which has been at the forefront of our design. During development, we identified areas for improvement and optimization. The audio quality had noise and cracking, which may be due to the 8-bit resolution of the current ADC. Using an external ADC with a higher bit depth could enhance the audio quality. Additionally, implementing a capacitor trick at the NRFL2401 pin, as suggested online, may improve radio signal quality, although it has not been tested yet. We found that the chip's multicast feature enables driving multiple amplifiers with a single transmitter. This feature can be enabled and used anytime without any additional change. Using a 16-byte payload per package yielded satisfactory results, but custom byte correction could be implemented for more robust transmission. The Auto Acknowledge feature was not viable due to timing issues, which led to unacceptable latency levels. The 400Âµs per transmission, coupled with the 1.2ms already present, rendered this feature impractical for our application. There has also been an attempt to implement a tuner in our project using the Yin algorithm. The main code is there, but we have not yet done the actual connection with DMA or the necessary tests. Therefore, we have not included it in the final state of the project. Despite its limitations, the prototype successfully achieved the project's primary goal of serving as a functional guitar transmitter. The audio quality exceeded expectations, despite some cracking and noise. This is particularly impressive given the modest 20kHz sample rate and 8-bit depth used in the prototype. Although the prototype cannot be marketable, we are satisfied with the results.
